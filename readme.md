Hei!

I am building a web 2.0 blogging platform since 2018 rip :P

Inspired by: Classic weblogs, Tumblr blogs with themes, independent photography portfolio websites, linktrees, the note taking app Obsidian (accumulative writing and structuring of pages). 

In the marketplace:
- No platform overhead when publishing, unlike social media
- Dead simple setup, editing and maybe social features, unlike website generators

Target platform: Web â€“ Mobile, desktop and social media app browsers. 

Stack: AWS S3 & CloudFront, Firebase, client side vanilla JS, custom libs.

Architecture: Serverless SPA. MVC, pub-sub with constant topics for coupling. 

"Klatremus" ("climbing mouse") is current project iteration.

Currently launched as indev test site @ snublr.net.
